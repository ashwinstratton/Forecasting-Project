# COVID vs Twitch
Final Project from Forecasting

Assignment :

Choose a quantitative variable that you wish to forecast, and then think about what external variables could
plausibly be used to forecast your variable of interest. You will conduct a thorough analysis determining
whether your external variables actually have any predictive power.

Result :

I learned how to create a report through R, and RStudio. Through this though I was able to run various tests on multiple datasets to prove whether certain factors had impact on Twitch viewer numbers. Whether peloton sales, travel, covid, or planet fitness data had any impact on viewer count over time during the pandemic.
